## Troubleshooting
This mod is in early development. There might be some bugs or edge-cases which haven't been handled, yet. The demand "system" is much more sophisticated in Cities: Skylines 2 as it was in 1. If you found any bugs or missing features, please report them here: https://github.com/johnytoxic/CSL2DemandControl/issues.
