# Infinite Demand Mod
Bringing back this essential mod from _Cities: Skylines_ for a better sandbox experience. This mod always sets the demand to infinite, so that new zones always get built immediately.

Please note, that the game simulation is rather complex, so your actual demand might depend on other factors (e.g. citizens, work places, etc.)

NOTE: The demand isn't shown immediately. Hit play and speed up the simulation.

## Feedback
This mod is in early development. There might be some bugs or edge-cases which haven't been handled, yet. If you found any bugs or missing features, please report them here: https://github.com/johnytoxic/CSL2DemandControl/issues.

## Troubleshooting
If the game does not start at all or the mod doesn't work (i.e. you don't notice any change in Demand), please check the `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` file in your game directory for any errors.
